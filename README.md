# PocketSynth
 Android PianoKeyboard/Synth App

About this project:

This project is an exploration of the challenges of real-time audio development for the Android platform. It started as a monophonic sine-wave synthesizer and has grown to allow polyphony and two octave piano keyboard UI. My plans are to improve on the sound quality, reduce latency, and add the ability for the user to adjust parameters and tweak the sound to their liking. I'd also like to be able to record clips to save musical thoughts and export them for use beyond the mobile platform.

Installation:

Dependencies: aaudio library

Full installation instructions are in the works. For now, I recommend using Android Studio and ensuring you're environment is set up to handle native development in C++. I've underlined the critical settings in the photo below.
